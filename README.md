# STLtoC
C codes that I have implemented to mimic the functionality of C++'s STL with a focus on achieving similar time complexity and features as in theory.
<br/>I started with the aim of practicing and improving my skills.
<br/>References from 'cppreference.com' and various data structure-related resources were used as guides during the implementation.
